## Hi there 👋

**BitDevsNBO** is a community in Nairobi, Kenya, for those interested in discussing and participating in the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols and software.

### Socratic Seminars

We host monthly events formatted as [Socratic Seminar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method#Socratic_seminar) to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussions.
In the weeks preceding the event, discussion topics are collated by our members from a variety of sources: pull requests in popular git repositories (e.g. Bitcoin Core, lnd, c-lightning, Joinmarket, Elements Alpha, Fedimint and Electrum), research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs, network monitors and more.

During the socratic seminar meeting, members present open source projects, companies, research and other relevant materials.
A feedback and Q&A section follow. After the event the group may gather at a nearby restaurant to continue socializing.
